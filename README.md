About Dataset
The dataset was obtained from a training practice

Data Cleaning
The data was cleaned in Power Query, where:
Duplicates were removed
Missing values were worked out using Average imputation and replaced. 
Data was looked up from another table. 
The Date Column, initially saved as text, was converted 
The quantity column saved as a date was converted to a quantity
Date path extraction was implemented to extract day, month,th, and year.
And the customer's age is extracted from the customer's date of birth column.

Insights:
The company made losses as a result of the returned items. Manager Path is to be promoted, looking at the region he is covering and the profit
He and his team realized. The other managers made smaller profits, which, despite this, could be from the location they are working out of,
but are encouraged to put in more effort or, better still, ask Pat for the secret to his success and be able to work out ways to 
implement them in their region.


Recommendations.
The other managers who made smaller profits should learn from the managers performing better so as a have a better output in the coming year.
